# GT Physics REU Workshop -- Git Tutorial

Name: Erik Teder

## Do you have a github account?
I do have a  [github account](https://github.com/bldrerik) and my username is bldrerik.

## What programming languages do you know?
I know **Python**, **C++**, and some **Java**. I am most comfortable with *Python* because of how accessible it is, the vast range of useful libraries for almost any basic task, and I've taken a computational physics class based in it. 
I want to learn more MATLAB as I have minimal experience with it.

## What do you hope to gain from this REU?
The main thing I'm hoping to gain from this REU is first-hand knowledge about what life in an R1 research environment looks like.
My school does not have graduate-level science research, so pretty much every aspect of lab life is new to me. I'm also
looking to build more robust experimental and programming skills. I also want a better understanding of image processing techniques,
CAD, 3D printing, and MATLAB.
