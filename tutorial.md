# Initial instructions

* Use Github Desktop to create a git tag called “initial” in your repository by right-clicking the latest commit in your history.
* Then create a new git branch called “readme” in your repository.
* Checkout the “readme” branch and modify README.md to answer the following questions.

## Questions

1. Do you have a github account? If so, make a link to it. If not, make a link to the github front page. The title of the link should be “github account”.

2. What programming languages do you know? If you know multiple ones, which one are you most comfortable with?

3. In 3-5 sentences, what do you hope to gain from the REU?

## Additional instructions

Put each answer after a “Header 2” (i.e. ##) entry and use bold and italic faces at least once. Commit your changes to the “readme” branch, using a descriptive commit message (this applies to all commits!). Make sure that your markdown renders as you expected without errors. For example, VSCode has an extension that allows you to view rendered Markdown. There is also a Chrome extension to view Markdown.

## Alternative method

Alternatively but not recommended, you can push your changes to your repository and view the README on github. /_Note:_ If you do this last option, you’ll have to switch to the readme branch on github to view it. Also you’ll have to push your readme branch with “git push origin readme”.
